### Welcome
A brief intro.  Who I am.  What I do.  Why I make maps.

### What we're going to create
Describe what we're creating and what we'll learn.

### Intro to MapBox Studio
Not comprehensive.  Talk about the editor.  The CartoCSS markup.
Start by changing a few properties.

### Incendio!
Ask people to import fire data source that lives on MapBox.

### Playing With Fire
* Make the points appear as a marker
* Style different causes as different colors
* Combine with radius for year to create smaller circles for older years
* [Maybe] Discuss zoom-level styling
* Move on to using an emoji or vector symbol for fire

### What next?
* Print your map!
* Find data. Have fun. Be responsible.
